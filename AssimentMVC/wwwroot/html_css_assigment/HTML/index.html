        <h2>Battlefield V</h2>
        <p>World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a
                global war
                that lasted from 1939 to 1945.
                The vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing
                military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.
                A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries.
                The major participants threw their entire economic,
                industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian
                and military resources.
                World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of
                whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China.
                It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from
                starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.[1][2][3][4]</p>

                    History of Norway.
                    The military history of Norway commences before the Viking age with the internal wars fought
                    between
                    regional kings to obtain the supreme kingship of the whole of Norway. The most famous period of
                    Norwegian history and thus military history is the Viking age, but the early Middle Ages was the era
                    when Norwegian military power in Europe reached its peak. Since then the Norwegian military has
                    experienced long periods of neglect, but also rearmament and victories.
